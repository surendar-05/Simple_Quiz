# Simple_Quiz

A simple quiz in JavaScript is a program that presents a series of questions to the user and checks their answers. It typically includes a user interface to display the questions and options, collect user input, and provide feedback on the correctness of the answers.

Here's a basic description of how you can implement a simple quiz in JavaScript:

1.Create an array of objects, where each object represents a question. Each question object should have properties such as the question itself, options, and the correct answer.

2.Create a variable to keep track of the user's score, initialized to 0.

3.Display the first question to the user along with the available options. You can use HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly interface.

4.Listen for the user's input, such as clicking on an option or submitting a form. When the user submits their answer, capture their choice.

5.Compare the user's choice with the correct answer for the current question. If the answer is correct, increment the score variable.

6.Display feedback to the user indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect.

7.Move to the next question and repeat steps 3 to 6 until all questions have been answered.

8.After the last question, display the user's final score and optionally provide an option to restart the quiz.

This is a high-level overview of how a simple quiz in JavaScript can be implemented. The specific implementation details may vary based on your requirements and the programming environment you are using.
